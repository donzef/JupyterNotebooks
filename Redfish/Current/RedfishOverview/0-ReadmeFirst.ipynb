    "# Introduction to Redfish API Use With PowerShell, Python and Bash/cURL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract**: After a quick positioning of the DMTF Redfish API, we'll explore a Redfish tree to understand its basic structure. In addition we'll learn how to modify resources and perform actions using different tools. Best practices will be presented as well. Beginners and experts are welcome.\n",

    "## Handouts\n",
    "You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.\n",
    "- You install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install). \n",
    "- A Beginners Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)\n",
    "To download the notebooks, just right click on them and select `Download`.\n",

    "## Workshop goal\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the workshop, you should be able to 1) explain the basic architecture of the Redfish resource tree; 2) explain why it is crucial to follow [best practices](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/getting-started-with-ilo-restful-api-redfish-api-conformance) when programming the Redfish API; and 3) explain the session-based authentication mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each student, or team, has a dedicated [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) environment hosted by a Linux host that provides a set of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks can access a dedicated [OpenBMC](https://www.openbmc.org/) appliance simulator with `GET` and `SET` methods, and a shared [HPE iLO 5](http://hpe.com/info/ilo) (in `GET` mode only).\n",
