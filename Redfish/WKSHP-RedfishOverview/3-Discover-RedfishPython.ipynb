    "This notebook contains a single Python program, explained and executed step by step. The goal of this lab is to retrieve the BMC MAC addresses from an OpenBMC and from an HPE iLO 5 using a single piece of code.\n",

    "The following cell imports the minimum required Python modules and defines **global variables** (credentials and IP addresses). The `redfish` module has been installed on the Jupyter server using the `pip3 install redfish` command as explained in the [DMTF's Python Redfish library](https://github.com/DMTF/python-redfish-library) GitHub site."
