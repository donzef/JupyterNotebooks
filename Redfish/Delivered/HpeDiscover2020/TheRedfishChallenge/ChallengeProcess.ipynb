    "# HPE DISCOVER Hack Shack Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided by [HPEDEV Team](hpedev.io)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Hack Shack Challenges. If you are reading this, you have already registered to one of the following four challenges that will be offered over the course of this HPE Discover Virtual Experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The HPE OneView Challenge\n",
    "2. The Redfish Challenge\n",
    "3. The Grommet Challenge\n",
    "4. The Container Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: If you have enough time, we encourage you to take all of them (in this order). At the very least, youâ€™ll want to participate in those where the subject matter is relevant to your job.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The HPE OneView Challenge \n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to implement vSphere VSAN on an HPE Synergy Composable Infrastructure. You will be asked to prepare a server profile template according to published best practices, and do it in a scripted way so that you can deploy it across your enterprise in different datacenters and different Synergy environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Languages & Tools: PowerShell, GitHub\n",
    "- Estimated time to complete: 1 hour\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Redfish Challenge \n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission here will be to write the smallest possible program (in terms of number of Redfish API calls) that retrieves the complete Device Inventory list from an HPE iLO 5, and to display the following properties for each device: Location, Product Name, Firmware Version (if applicable) and Status. Remember, you only have so much time. Be quick and be sharp!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Languages & Tools: PowerShell, Python or Bash, GitHub\n",
    "- Estimated time to complete: 1 hour\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Grommet Challenge \n",
    "\n",
    "A new mission awaits! In this challenge, you will take on a UX designer persona and show your creative side using Grommet to design your own little web app UI. You will start with the Grommet Designer, generate code from your design, push that code to GitHub, and finally deploy the app on Netlify. Beginner through expert designers and developers are all welcome. This challenge is all about unleashing your creativity!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Languages & Tools: Grommet Designer, GitHub, Netlifly\n",
    "- Estimated time to complete: 2 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Container Challenge \n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is undoubtedly the most complicated one as it's an end-to-end developer experience. Your mission here will be to build a Grommet sample app (or reuse the one from the Grommet Challenge), package it in a container, and then run that container in a Kubernetes Cluster. This challenge touches on several technologies, such as front-end web application design, Docker containers and Kubernetes. Be ready for an intense moment when all the pieces of the puzzle will suddenly make total sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Languages & Tools: Grommet Designer, Docker, DockerHub, Kubectl, GitHub\n",
    "- Estimated time to complete: 4 hours\n",

    "# Getting started with your Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "![HPEDEV](Pictures/ChallengeProcess.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every HPE Discover Virtual Experience 2020 Hack Shack Challenge uses GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks to provide instructions for the challenge and to accept the answers submitted by participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to go through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Fork the repo of the challenge you'd like to take from https://github.com/HPEDevCom\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Clone your copy of the challenge repo into your Jupyter environment. Do do this, use the Terminal session from the Jupyter Launcher. If you don't have any Launcher pane, click on the `+` sign in the upper left of the left pane.\n",
    "\n",
    "![HPEDEV](Pictures/Launcher.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the Terminal session, change folder to Discover/TheXXXChallenge where XXX is the challenge you are taking (Oneview, Redfish, Grommet, Container)\n",
    "- Use git CLI clone from there\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Open the challenge notebook in your Jupyter environment (now visible in the left pane) and start working on it\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Use the [GIT101 notebook](./WKSHP-GIT101/1-WKSHP-GIT-Basics.ipynb) if you need assistance with these steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the challenges have workshop prerequisites. The notebooks for these workshops have been copied in your Jupyter environment within folders called WKSHP-NameOfWorkshop. Don't hesitate to refer to these notebooks if you missed the live workshop. You may also refer to the recorded version of the workshop. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Racing against the clock\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you are working against the clock. You have 4 hours after we provided you access to the Jupyter account to submit your response. If you find you are running out of time, make sure you commit and push your changes to your copy of the repo in order to avoid losing any work.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Submitting your response\n",
    "\n",
    "Submitting your response to the challenge will be done by submitting your edited challenge notebook (in some cases there might be additional edited files in the repo). When you are ready, we will ask you to leverage GitHub again and do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Commit changes in your Jupyter environment  (again using your Launcher terminal window)\n",
    "- Step 2: Push changes to your repo  (still using your Launcher terminal window)\n",
    "- Step 3: Open a Pull Request (PR) on our original repo. Make sure you provide an email in the description of the PR so we can contact you if your submission has been chosen. (This step is done from your GitHub account).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit your response within the 4-hour time slot. We will reset all the Jupyter accounts right after the time is up, so make sure you have at least committed and pushed your changes back to your repo prior to that. You will then have more time to submit your PR.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Use the [GIT101 notebook](./WKSHP-GIT101/1-WKSHP-GIT-Basics.ipynb) if you need assistance with these steps\n",
    "\n",
    "# Looking for help?\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't hesitate to refer back to the notebooks in your Jupyter accounts for help in answering questions that come up in the challenge. We have set up a Slack channel in the HPE DEV Slack Workspace. Feel free to [join the workspace](https://slack.hpedev.io/) then [start asking questions there](https://hpedev.slack.com/archives/C015CLE2QTT). We will be around to help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in case of a real emergency, you can contact the [HPEDEV Team](mailto:hpedev.hackshack@hpe.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that during the period of June 30th, until July 17th the Slack channel will be opened 24x7, with monitoring from the HPE DEV Team from 9AM-6PM CET.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Providing feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "We would love to get feedback about your experience with the Hack Shack Challenges, so please take a moment to fill out that [short survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=YSBbEGm2MUuSrCTTBNGV3KHzFdd987lBoQATWJq45DdUNEVQTzdQV1NZM1MxNVVDMDRPRlFGUTlaQi4u) for us:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "We will select and reward the best response per challenge subject at the end of the HPE Discover Virtual Experience Challenges period. In addition to this, we will have a drawing amongst all the challengers who participated in all four challenges and also reward this super-challenger. \n",
