    "# Introduction to Redfish API Use With PowerShell Python and Bash/cURL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract**: After a quick positioning of the DMTF Redfish API, we'll explore a Redfish tree to understand its basic structure. In addition we'll learn how to modify resources and perform actions using different tools. Best practices will be presented as well. Beginners and experts are welcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lab flow\n",
    "HackShack Workshops are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb). These Jupyter Notebooks are accessible from the internet for the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handouts\n",
    "You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.\n",
    "- You install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install). \n",
    "- A Beginners Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)\n",
    "To download the notebooks, just right click on them and select `Download`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please listen now to the instructor's guidelines on how to use Jupyter and follow along as the different steps are covered. Enjoy the labs!\n",

    "\n",
    "At the end of the workshop, you should be able to 1) explain the basic architecture of the Redfish resource tree; 2) explain why it is crucial to follow [best practices](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/getting-started-with-ilo-restful-api-redfish-api-conformance) when programming the Redfish API; and 3) explain the session-based authentication mechanism.\n",
