    "# Welcome to the DISCOVER Hack Shack Redfish Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 0.81\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook provides a detailed description of the HPE Discover Virtual Experience Hack Shack **Redfish Challenge**  as well as the instructions to retrieve the response templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you attend the following Discover Hack Shack workshops before attempting this challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Git 101](WKSHP-GIT101/0-ReadmeFirst.ipynb)  `# Only if you have not already mastered Git basics`\n",
    "2. [Hack Shack W482](WKSHP-RedfishOverview/0-ReadmeFirst.ipynb): Introduction to Redfish API Use With PowerShell, Python and Bash/cURL\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not, please make sure you leverage the notebooks provided in your Jupyter environment for reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge description\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this challenge is to retrieve the information provided in the `System Information --> Device Inventory` view of an iLO 5 with a minimum number of Redfish GET requests in order to automate as much processing as possible in  in the remotely managed Redfish engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following screenshot shows the `Device Inventory` list of a HPE DL360 Gen10 server and the properties you have to retrieve: `Location`, `Product Name`, `Product Version`, `Firmware Version`, `Status`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Device Inventory from iLO GUI](Pictures/DeviceInventoryFromiLOGUI.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When judging the winner of this challenge, int the case of a tie, session authenticated programs will receive a higher score. Programs implementing good Redfish practices (meaning crawling the Redfish tree to find the resources path instead of assuming a definite location) will also receive a higher score.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a program discovering the list and the names of all the chassis in a server will get a higher score than a program assuming that the first chassis is called `1`, the second `2`...\n",
    "\n",
    "The formating of the output is not an important criteria; a raw JSON output is fine.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Language choices\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have a limited number of languages (kernels) available in this Jupyter infrastructure, you will have to choose among one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bash/cURL\n",
    "* PowerShell\n",
    "* Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the above templates contains the information necessary to achieve your challenge (i.e. iLO 5 IP address, credentials...).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fork the Challenge Repo\n",
    "\n",
    "We leverage GitHub to provide the response templates and collect your response. This means that your response will be delivered via a Git Pull Request in this [RedfishChallenge](https://github.com/HPEDevCom/RedfishChallenge) repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "But before you submit your response, **you need to fork** this [Redfish Challenge](https://github.com/HPEDevCom/RedfishChallenge.git) repository into your own GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "![GitFork](Pictures/GitFork.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clone the repo in your Jupyter environment \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a copy of the repo in your own GitHub account, **you have to clone** it into this Jupyter environment. Here are the basic steps required to achieve this clone:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy the Redfish GitHub repo location in **your clipboard**\n",
    "\n",
    "![ClipboardGitLocation](Pictures/ClipboardOfGit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From your Jupyter environment, **Select `Terminal`** at the bottom left of the main `Launcher` pane, . If you don't have any Launcher pane, click on the `+` sign in the upper left of the left pane.\n",
    "\n",
    "![LauncherPane](Pictures/StartTerminal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Perform the **clone**\n",
    "\n",
    "Issue the following commands in your terminal, using Ctlr-V to paste the content of your clipboard: \n",
    "\n",
    "```Bash\n",
    "cd Discover/TheRedfishChallenge\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/<YourGitHubLocation>/RedfishChallenge.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![GitClone](Pictures/GitClone.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work on your challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the content of the Redfish Challenge repo is downloaded in your Jupyter account, from the left pane, navigate to the `RedfishChallenge` directory and open your preferred language response template notebook in Jupyter:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * [Bash/cURL](RedfishChallenge/BashRedfishChallenge.ipynb)\n",
    "  * [PowerShell](RedfishChallenge/PowerShellRedfishChallenge.ipynb)\n",
    "  * [Python](RedfishChallenge/PythonRedfishChallenge.ipynb)\n",
    "  \n",
    "![ChooseLanguage](Pictures/ChooseLanguage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's now time for you to do the real work :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Racing against the clock\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you are working against the clock here. You have 4 hours after we provided you access to the Jupyter account. If your time is running out, make sure you commit and push your changes to your copy of the repo in order to avoid losing any work."
